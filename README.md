# NFTfiedHealth
Inspiration
Inspired from behavioral science and digital therapy that aimed to evaluate if self-guided digital therapy based on cognitive behavioral therapy could be effective in the treatment of mental health wellness domain. Similar trials have found that such courses can be as effective in treating depression and anxiety.

While there are several NFT projects which serve to empower individuals, we don’t normally hear the topic of mental health permeate through the Web3 community.

NFTs allowed us to build a community alongside our application, which allows us to build alongside our community. This has the added benefit of opening conversations about mental health while providing a safe space for our users.
